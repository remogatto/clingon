# What's that?

Clingon (Command Line INterface for GO Nuts) is a Go library that
helps in creating command-line interfaces à la Quake. Can't wait to
see how does it look? Watch this
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nee3BOtvUCE) (early version) and
see if it is worth reading below.

Clingon exploits a parallel and (hopefully) clean design. Basically,
there are four parts running in parallel:

* The console: it runs (almost) in the same goroutine of the
  client-code and it exposes console functionalities to it. The client
  modifies the console state through a simple API. When a new console
  instance is created, a goroutine is spawned. This goroutine simply
  triggers the "blink cursor" event to the renderer at regular time's
  interval.

* The renderer: it responds to the events triggered by the console in
  order to render a graphical representation of the console state. A
  renderer object should implement the Renderer interface.

* The animation service: it provides a stream of changing values used
  for animations. For example, this service provides the changing Y
  coordinate as a function of time in order to achieve the console
  sliding effect.

* The evaluator: it evaluates the commands sent to the console
  providing back a result. It implements the Evaluator interface.

Because of its design, clingon could be a neat choice for adding
console functionalities to games and graphical applications. For
example, it is used in
[gospeccy](https://github.com/remogatto/gospeccy/tree/clingon)
to provide a non-blocking CLI which runs in parallel with the emulator.

Moreover, the fact that console operations are isolated from the
rendering backend allows for non-blocking graphical effects.

Clingon tries to emulate a part of readline functionalities for line
editing. At the moment, only a very small subset of the whole readline
commands are available. However, clingon will never offer a complete
readline emulation as it's simply not needed in games. See the
Features section for more details.

Clingon is completely renderer-agnostic. Currently, only an SDL
renderer is being shipped with the package but it should not be
difficult to add more backends (e.g. opengl, draw/x11, etc.)

# Features

* Concurrent design
* Graphical backend agnostic (currently an SDL renderer is included)
* Console scrolling
* Readline-like commands
  * left/right cursor movements
  * up/down history browsing

# Installation

    go get -v github.com/remogatto/clingon

After installing the package try the sample code in <tt>example/</tt>
folder:

    cd $GOPATH/github.com/remogatto/clingon/example
    make run

# TODO

* Improve readline emulation by adding more commands
* Add new rendering backends
* Add more graphical effects
* Experimenting with clingon + exp/eval + draw2d
